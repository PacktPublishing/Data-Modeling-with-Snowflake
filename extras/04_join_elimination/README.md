## Snowflake join elimination can save you time and money. Learn how to use it to your advantage.

Declaring relational constraints has always been a modeling best practice for the operational insight they provide. Thanks to the join elimination made possible through the RELY property, defining constraints now pays literal dividends in time and warehouse credits saved.
